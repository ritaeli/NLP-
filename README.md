# NLP-
NLP text classification using word2vec model and classification algorithms including logistic regression, knn and naive bayes. Tested finally on unlabelled data. 

imported librairies for text-preprocessing, model-building, bag of words and word embedding

Data Organization: 'results' column created based on conditions

Class distribution using sns (seaborn) barplot

Preprocessing (stopword, stemming, lemmatization and tokenization)

word2vec model 

Train and test splitting of the labelled dataset with validation

Classification models (knn, logistic regression and naive bayes) including the model accuracy, f1-score for each classification and the confusion matrix
(a heatmap using sns was used to represent multi-classification confusion matrix)

Testing on unlabelled data
